<p>The theme behind <a href="http://stammalexanderlion.de/">http://stammalexanderlion.de/</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="What_the_heck_3"></a>What the heck?</h2>
<p>al3 is a WordPress theme and, most noticeable, the driving force behind <a href="http://stammalexanderlion.de/">http://stammalexanderlion.de/</a>. It is, therefore, a very specific and not quite universal to use theme, but if you like , fork it and make it your own.</p>
<h2><a id="Why_6"></a>Why?</h2>
<p>al3 roughly started in 2014, when <a href="http://stammalexanderlion.de/">http://stammalexanderlion.de/</a> was in need of a new website. I started editing a few previous theme files, before I realized that a total relaunch might be the better option. So I reworked the shit out of the website and wrote al3.</p>

<ul>
<li>The theme al3 is actually based on Bones (<a href="https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones">https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones</a>) by Eddie Machado. I dare you to take a look at his work. I pretty much reworked the entire theme, but deep inside, al3 still runs on <em>Bones</em>.</li>
