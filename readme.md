# al3
The theme behind http://stammalexanderlion.de/.

## What the heck?
al3 is a WordPress theme and, most noticeable, the driving force behind http://stammalexanderlion.de/. It is, therefore, a very specific and not quite universal to use theme, but if you like , fork it and make it your own.

## Why?
al3 roughly started in 2014, when http://stammalexanderlion.de/ was in need of a new website. I started editing a few previous theme files, before I realized that a total relaunch might be the better option. So I reworked the shit out of the website and wrote al3.

## Credits  & Thanks
* The theme al3 is actually based on Bones (https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) by Eddie Machado. I dare you to take a look at his work. I pretty much reworked the entire theme, but deep inside, al3 still runs on *Bones*.
